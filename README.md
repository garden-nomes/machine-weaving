# MachineWeaving
Machines can weave too

## Goals
1. Create python program that generates a bitmap from a .wif (open weave draft format) file
2. Fuck around with machine learning stuff using that program
3. Profit???

## Issues
Newest upload of the pyweave program constantly outputs weird BMPs that look all brown and purple,
and are super staticy -Eli


### .WIF files
Can be downloaded from handweaving.net or saved form WeavePoint.  Open it up with a text editor to see how they're formatted -- it should be fairly easy to parse in Python.

### Image Generation
Take a look at the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/).

## Best of luck!
